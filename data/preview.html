      <h2>Preliminary Loan Debt Data by Field of Study</h2>
        
      <p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is encouraging institutions of higher education to</p>
      <ol>
          <li>evaluate the accuracy of reported program-level data to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and</li>
          <li>make any updates necessary to correct incomplete or inaccurate data.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Department will use updated NSLDS data to calculate the College Scorecard data metrics prescribed by the March 2019 Executive Order on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-free-inquiry-transparency-accountability-colleges-universities/" target="_blank">Improving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and Universities</a>. To support this effort, the Department is providing this data file with preliminary cumulative loan debt data by field of study:</p>

                <a data-download href="{{ site.downloads.data-base_url }}/" class="button button-primary">Download Preliminary Data</a>
            </div>
            <div class="u-group_inline-right">
                <p>NN MB zip</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <ul class="data-download-list">
            <li><a data-download href="{{ site.downloads.data-base_url }}/">Preliminary Loan Debt Data by Field of Study Documentation</a> N MB XLS</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>The Department encourages institutions to compare these preliminary data values with their internal records to evaluate the accuracy of previously reported data.  In addition, this preliminary College Scorecard data file provides corresponding data from the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) completion survey. To the extent that awards conferred should generally be reported consistently in IPEDS and NSLDS, the Department encourages institutions to use these IPEDS data as a comparison in evaluating the accuracy of previously reported NSLDS program-level enrollment data.</p>
 
        <p>The primary purpose of publishing preliminary loan debt data is to help guide institutions in updating their historical data reported to the Department. Given these data are preliminary, the Department does not recommend using these data for informing enrollment decisions. Once historical data have been updated, the Department will release a revised version of program-level loan debt data appropriate for a wider audience.</p>
