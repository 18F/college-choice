avg-cost-year:
  title: Average Annual Cost (after grants/scholarships)
  default: The average annual net price that a student who receives federal financial aid pays to cover expenses (e.g. tuition, living expenses, etc.) to attend a school.  Net price is the school's cost of attendance minus any grants and scholarships received. For public schools, this is only the average cost for in-state students.
  negative: The average annual net price that a student who receives federal financial aid pays to cover expenses (e.g. tuition, living expenses, etc.) to attend a school.  Net price is the school's cost of attendance minus any grants and scholarships received. For public schools, this is only the average cost for in-state students. Negative cost values indicate that the average grant/scholarship aid exceeded the cost of attendance.
  glossary: <p>The average annual cost is the average <em>net price</em> for students who receive federal financial aid (e.g. Pell grants, federal loans) for one academic year of study. Net price is calculated by adding the advertised price for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and the average living costs at the school (on-campus, off-campus not with family, and off-campus with family) and subtracting the average grant and/or scholarship aid (e.g., Pell grants, school-based grants, merit scholarships). Net price is calculated as the average over all full-time, first-time students who receive federal financial aid and may not reflect a specific student's annual costs.  For public schools, this is only the average cost for in-state students. Negative cost values indicate that the average grant/scholarship aid exceeded the cost of attendance.</p>
avg-program-cost:
  title: Average Annual Cost (after grants/scholarships) for Largest Program 
  default: The average annual net price that a student who receives federal financial aid pays to cover expenses (e.g. tuition, living expenses, etc.) to attend the school's largest program. Net price is the program's cost of attendance minus any grants and scholarships received. 
  glossary: <p>The average annual cost for the largest program is the average <em>net price</em> for students who receive federal financial aid (e.g. Pell grants, federal loans) for one academic year of study. Net price is calculated by adding the advertised price for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and the average living costs at the school (on-campus, off-campus not with family, and off-campus with family) and subtracting the average grant and/or scholarship aid (e.g., Pell grants, school-based grants, merit scholarships). Note that this is an average over all full-time, first-time students who received federal financial aid in the largest program and may not reflect a specific student's annual costs. For public schools, this is only the average cost for in-state students. Negative cost values indicate that the average grant/scholarship aid exceeded the cost of attendance.</p><p>The advertised price is reported for the full program, which may span more than one academic year. In cases where the program length is 1 academic year or shorter, the average annual cost for the largest program represents the full program costs. When the program length is longer than 1 academic year, the average annual cost for the largest program represents the average costs for a single academic year of study. In this situation, advertised prices are annualized using the school's reported academic year in credit/contract hours. Average grant and/or scholarship aid is reported for an annual period and is not adjusted.</p>

  title: Socio-Economic Diversity
  default: Percent of students receiving an income-based federal Pell Grant intended for low-income students.
  glossary: <p>The percentage of students that receive a federal Pell Grant provides an indication of the level of socio-economic diversity at the school since Pell Grants are awarded based on income. Notably, this measure may not capture all low-income students since foreign nationals (including undocumented immigrants) are not eligible for Pell Grants, and some otherwise eligible students may not have completed the application for federal student aid, which is required to receive a Pell Grant. This proportion is calculated for undergraduate students enrolled in either the fall (for academic year-based schools) or over the course of the whole year (for program calendar-based schools). </p>

Awards are categorized into 4 groups: undergraduate certificates of any level, associate's degrees, bachelor's degrees, and graduate awards of any level. schools that only conferred graduate awards are classified as 'graduate-only' and are not currently included in the Scorecard consumer website. All other schools are classified using the 3 undergraduate award groups, with the group having the largest number of awards serving as the predominant award. Should the largest number of awards be the same for 2 groups, the higher level award is assigned (e.g., associate's degree is selected in a tie between the associate's degree group and the certificate group).
